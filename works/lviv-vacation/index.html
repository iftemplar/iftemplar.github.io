                Nice place with very limited space: you’ll be sitting on top of each other’s heads if it’s full. Half of the menu wasn’t available when we visited which was very disappointing. But dishes that we’ve tried were very good, especially their savory pancakes. Also loved coffee with liquor. Baked pear was tasteless, but sauces it was served with were delicious.
